### Game Development ðŸŽ®
Outside of personal projects, I have done internships at both *Standing Stone Games* in Boston as well as *Digital Extremes* in Ontario, where I worked in C++ on game systems, tools, databases, UI and more, for massive titles such as *Warframe*. You can find my full professional profile [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jadenbalogh/).

I am also the founder of UBCO's Video Game Development Club, which now has over 300 members and nearly two dozen game projects. You can find all of our projects in [our GitHub organization](https://github.com/ubco-video-game-development-club).
